# Road Lane Detection using Computer Vision

This project implements a real-time road lane detection system using computer vision techniques. It processes input images or video frames from a car's front-facing camera to detect lane lines, enabling a foundational step towards advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving cars.

#üîç Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to:

Identify and highlight lane markings on roads.

Provide visual cues for vehicle navigation.

Work on both static images and video streams.

#üõ† Features
Preprocessing techniques (grayscale, Gaussian blur, edge detection).

Region of interest masking.

Hough Transform for detecting lane lines.

Visualization of detected lanes on original frames.

Real-time video support via webcam or video files.
